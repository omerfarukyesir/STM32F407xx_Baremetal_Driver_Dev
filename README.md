# STM32F407xx Baremetal Drivers

This repository documents the bare-metal driver development process for the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller. 
All drivers are implemented from scratch in C, without relying on HAL or CMSIS libraries.

The purpose of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the STM32 architecture, peripheral register-level programming, and to develop reusable low-level drivers suitable for professional embedded systems development. 

The repository currently includes drivers for GPIO and SPI peripherals. Experiments are designed to validate each driver module and demonstrate their integration in practical scenarios, such as LED toggling and SPI data transmission.

This repository serves both as a learning archive for embedded systems enthusiasts and as a professional portfolio showcasing low-level driver development skills.
